    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <p>Here's a brief overview of the steps to make this creamy sun-dried tomato pasta:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 2 cups cream in a large saucepan over medium heat until just bubbling. Watch carefully to ensure that it doesn't boil over. Whisk in Asiago cheese and bouillon until cheese is melted and bouillon is dissolved. Add cornstarch mixture; simmer until sauce is thickened, stirring constantly. Mix in sun-dried tomatoes. Set Asiago cream sauce aside or cover and refrigerate for later use.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook pasta in boiling water until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes; drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Cook bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain on paper towels; crumble and set aside.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Saut√© red onion in hot butter until soft and translucent. Add crumbled bacon and garlic; cook and stir for 2 minutes. Add chicken, green onion, and remaining 1 cup cream. Cook, stirring, until cream is heated through. Add Asiago cream sauce and cook until mixture is heated through.</li>
        <li>Add cooked pasta to the saucepan; toss until evenly coated. Sprinkle with parsley to serve.</li>
